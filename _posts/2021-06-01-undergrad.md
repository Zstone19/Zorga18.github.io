## Exoplanets
### Professor: Philip Armitage

In the Spring of 2020, I had taken a class called "Exoplanets", focused on giving an overview of exoplanets, their motions, compositions, formation, and observations. There were two major projects done throughout this course: one was a paper investigating a problem for exoplanets, and the other was a numerical simulation. My [research paper](/files/AST%20390%20Midterm.pdf) was focused on the hot jupiter inflation problem, and talked about its history and a variety of solutions that had been proposed over the years. For the [simulation](/files/AST390Final.pdf), I had used a Python-wrapped version of the planetary system simulator "rebound". This allows for the simulation of a variety of n-body scenarios, including planetary systems, protoplanetary disks, and the current solar system. I used rebound to model the solar system with the proposed "Planet X", and observe how it would affect the stability of the solar system over millions of years. Depending on the initial conditions of the orbit and characteristics of Planet X, even larger bodies such as Pluto and Neptune could have their orbits influenced siginificantly, sometimes ejecting Pluto from the solar system.

## Astronomy Lab
### Professor: Fred Walter

In the Fall of 2021, I enrolled in an undergraduate astronomy lab, designed to teach techniques of observational astronomy in all wavelengths and types of messengers. This course was composed of multiple core projects: a mock proposal for the Hubble Space Telescope, observing with the Mt. Stony Brook Observatory and presenting the obtained data, analyzing archived data, and presenting a poster of results. For the mock HST proposal, I proposed to observe the binary black hole candidate and AGN OJ 287 spectroscopoically, in order to observe changes in composition and motion of material within the object. Using the Observatory at Mt. Stony Brook, I, along with other students, attempted to observe the exoplanet system surrounding Kepler-20 over the course of several weeks. I had presented the data and analyzed it properly (bias-subtracting, flat-fielding, photometrically calibrating, etc), though the data was insufficient to show a transit of any exoplanet. More successfully, I analyzed spectroscopic data of the blazar BL Lacertae. This was particularly challenging seeing as BL Lac is a blazar, and therefore its spectrum ais more or less featureless and its spectral lines are severely Doppler broadened. However, using fitting and analysis methods in Python, as well as using spectral line databases such as NOST, I was able to make inferences about material within BL Lac and its implications. This analysis was then used for a presentation for the final project.
